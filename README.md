ASealevel rise vs population density. Two notebooks that combine the data and produce a bunch of images for further exploring.

To build, run the notebooks. Start with the Create elevation tiff one. You'll need a mapbox key. You'll also need to download
the population data, but the notebooks will tell you how.
